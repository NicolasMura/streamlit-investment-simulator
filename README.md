## Quick start

Create a new virtual environment in your project folder and activate that it:

```shell
  python3 -m venv .venv
```

Install dependencies;

```shell
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If necessary, install Streamlit in your environment:

```shell
  pip install streamlit
```

Test that the installation worked:

```shell
  streamlit hello
```

Use your new environment

```shell
  source .venv/bin/activate
  streamlit run simulator.py
```

When you're done using this environment, type ``deactivate`` to return to your normal shell.
